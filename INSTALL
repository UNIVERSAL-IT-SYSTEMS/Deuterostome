Steps:
(1) if a build for a different architecture/setup has been done previously:
	make distclean

(2) Configure:
	./configure.sh 

	Flags: --flag (default) : notes
		--prefix (/dm) : base directory for installation, particularly of executables
		--shprefix (<PREFIX>/sh) : directory for shell scripts
		--docprefix (<PREFIX>/doc) : directory for documentations
		--elprefix (<PREFIX>/emacs) : directory for emacs files (.el,.elc)
		--libprefix (<PREFIX>/lib) : directory for loadable dictionaries
		--psprefix (<PREFIX>/ps) : directory for ps libraries
		--type (current architecture) : architecture, such as Darwin-ppc7450
			   by default is a tag of the form os-arch, where os=uname -s
			   and arch=$(machine) for Darwin,
			   and arch=$(uname -i | sed 's/,.*//')$(uname -m) for Linux
			   Others do not have -arch.

(3) Build:
	make -R

(4) Install:
	sudo make -R install
	(sudo is necessary if building to a public directory, such as "/dm")

(5) Set-up emacs:
	Add to your `~/.emacs' file: (load "<ELPREFIX>/init"),
	where <ELPREFIX> is the emacs library location (by default "<PREFIX>/emacs",
	where <PREFIX> is by default "/dm").

(6) Startup emacs, and Meta-X dvt.
